# Project LinkedList

This is for the linked list program.

#Running Code

School server was used. Have all files from linked list program together when testing.
Compile using g++ *.cpp

Linked List will take a bit to finish inserting students from the .csv to porogram so be patient.
Once the program shows the menu it is ready to be used.
Three ID numbers are provided in menu to test with for insert to save time from guessing which ones are available.
