# 3110-Group6
# Project LinkedList

This is for the linked list program.

#Files needed to run linked list

main.cpp
testStudentswithLastName.csv


#Running Code

School server was used. Have all files from linked list program together when testing.
Compile using g++ *.cpp.
Then run ./a.out to start program.

Linked List will take a bit to finish inserting students from the .csv to program so be patient.
Once the program shows the menu it is ready to be used.
Three ID numbers are provided in menu to test with for insert to save time from guessing which ones are available.
